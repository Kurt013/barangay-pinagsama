This is a mini barangay website project assigned to us by our prof during my 2nd yr. While it was not used as a final project for submission
as it ended up being developed in wix. It served as a key for me to master the fundamentals.

Tech stack:
- HTML
- CSS

For context, this made me learn basic to intermediate html and css
